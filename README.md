## Abstract
- A basic DeX Web Application compatible for the Ethereum Network. 
- Web Application built on Svelte. 
- Smart Contract built using Solidity.

## Features
- Depositing of Ethereum to obtain local non-ERC20 token
- Creating liquidity pools between local non-ERC20 tokens and new non-ERC20 tokens.
- Swapping between user-created non-ERC20 tokens and/or local non-ERC20 token.
- Utlisation of the XYK model.

### Requirements
A Ganache network environment to compile and deploy the smart contract. Some modifications are needed on the code (mainly `DeX.svelte`) to ensure that the correct link and RPC contract is used.

### Disclaimer
Not tested for mainnet.
